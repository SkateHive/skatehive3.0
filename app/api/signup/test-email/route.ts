🚨 TEST EMAIL - ACCOUNT NOT CREATED YET 🚨

Hello ${username},

This is a TEST EMAIL to verify that email delivery is working properly before you create your actual Hive account.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your Hive account has NOT been created on the blockchain yet! This is just a preview of what your keys would look like.

Here are your generated keys for testing:

🔑 ACCOUNT KEYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏠 Owner Key (Master key - keep EXTREMELY safe):
${keys.owner}

⚡ Active Key (For transfers and wallet operations):
${keys.active}

📝 Posting Key (For posting and social interactions):
${keys.posting}

💌 Memo Key (For encrypted messages):
${keys.memo}

🔐 Master Password (Can derive all keys):
${keys.master}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 SECURITY REMINDERS:
• This is a TEST - your account has not been created on the blockchain yet
• Store these keys in a secure password manager
• Never share your private keys with anyone
• The Owner key should be kept offline and only used for account recovery
• Use the Posting key for daily interactions on Hive apps
• We cannot recover these keys if you lose them
